			<h1>Spongebob</h1>
			<hr width="100%">
			<p>SpongeBob is a sea sponge, but he is drawn to resemble a kitchen sponge, being rectangular and light yellow with a light olive-green outline. In earlier episodes, he is wider near the top and gets skinnier going further down. However, in the more recent episodes, he is more of a regular square shape. SpongeBob has large light blue eyes, a long, slightly curved nose, a large mouth with two prominent front buck teeth, dimples with three freckles on each cheek, and light olive-green pores. Although rarely seen in the series, he has light yellow hair, as seen on his driver's license and in the episode "The Sponge Who Could Fly." However, in the episode "Krusty Krab Training Video," he instead has a simple strand of black hair.</p>

			<h1>Squidward Q. Tentacles</h1>
			<hr width="100%">
			<p>Squidward Q. Tentacles is one of the main characters of the SpongeBob SquarePants franchise. He is the neighbor between SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star. He is a turquoise octopus who lives in a house shaped like an Easter Island head.

He works as the cashier of the Krusty Krab, a job he absolutely loathes. Squidward is a very selfish individual and displays an unjustified air of superiority.

He also has at least 492 self-portraits and is delusional about his talents, such as playing the clarinet, though hardly anyone considers him to be very good.</p>

			<h1>Plankton</h1>
			<hr width="100%">
			<p>Sheldon J. Plankton, more commonly known only as Plankton, is Mr. Krabs' business rival.

Plankton despises his rival Eugene Krabs for running a successful restaurant because his own restaurant, the Chum Bucket, is unsuccessful. Plankton runs the restaurant alongside his sapient computer wife Karen, who is usually the source of his evil plans.
His primary goal is to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula and put Mr. Krabs out of business. Plankton succeeds at stealing it in the movie, but his goal of world domination is eventually thwarted by SpongeBob. In "Friend or Foe," it is revealed that Mr. Krabs and Plankton were best friends during their childhood, but a dispute over the Krabby Patty secret formula ended their friendship, meaning that Plankton had a part in the creation of the Krabby Patty.

			<h1>Gary</h1>
			<hr width="100%">
			<p>Gary Wilson Jr. is a snail owned by SpongeBob SquarePants. He is Patrick Star's first cousin.[4] He resides in a pineapple house on 124 Conch Street, Bikini Bottom, Pacific Ocean with his owner, SpongeBob. He is voiced by Tom Kenny and first appears in the episode "Help Wanted."

He is a domesticated house pet with similar mannerisms to a cat, most notably his "meow," but has royal blood, as seen in the episode "Rule of Dumb." In the said episode, the royal family tree proves that Gary and Patrick are cousins, as their fathers were brothers. His mannerism and affinity for the finer things in life in previous episodes foreshadow his royal blood, with the only exception being his dislike for baths.
