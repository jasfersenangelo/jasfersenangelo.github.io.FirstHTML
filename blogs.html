			<h1>10 Towering Things I Notice In "Krusty Towers"</h1>
			<p><i>July 31, 2018</i></p>
			<hr width="100%">
			<img src="krusty.png">
			<p>NOTE: Most of the reasons are over-exxagerated, this is my second favorite Post-Movie, Pre-Sequel Episode besides Roller Cowards, a 9/10.</p>
			<ol>
			<li> Mr. Krabs took the elevator earlier, but he took the "employee elevator" later</li>
			<li>They kinda avert the plaque by having to have the customers stay at the hotel</li>
			<li> Patrick requires a Krabby Patty without crust, but later, he wants a lot with crust</li>
			<li>He wants his back clean, but there is no close-up or different coloring, he looks like his normal self</li>
			<li>How did Mr. Krabs not notice he was nude?</li>
			<li>Krabs again, averted the plaque by saying that Squidward can't go in</li>
			<li>Squidward wishes his mom was a better cook, then why did he request them?</li>
			<li>How did the Krusty Krab look the same as before, i mean, shouldn't it have cracks?</li>
			<li> How do people access the restarount door on the very top floor, is it for decoration?</li>
			<li>When the room was redesigned, it got larger</li>

			<h1>Band Geeks Episode opinion</h1>

			<h2>Review</h2>
			<hr width="100%">
			<p>This is probably the most overrated pre-movie episode. The starting with everyone signing up is pretty boring. The middle with everyone training is the reason I didn't rate this any lower, as it's kinda entertaining and there are a couple of jokes (though not absolutely hilarious). One problem I do have with the middle is that EVERYONE is a jerk for no reason. Like seriously, everyone starting fighting because Harold insulted Krabs for having big meaty claws? Why is everyone acting like jerks? Anyways, the ending is also very forced. How did SpongeBob and his crew be able to train from awful musicians to masters in just a few days? If we saw a montage of that, I could've forgive that they were able to do that, but since they don't, it just feels forced for them to be able to sing Sweet Victory in just a few days. It takes quite some time to be a master musician, and even longer to train an entire group. For the song, honestly, since it's not SpongeBob original, I didn't really care for it. I did however like that Squidward did win, though ending the episode with Squidward in the air being happy isn't exactly the best ending. Anyways, while this episode isn't bad, it has problems, though it has perks. This is your average Season 2 episode, and there's nothing different between this and other Season 2 episodes.</p>

			<h1>Bubble Stand Episode Opinions</h1>

			<h2>Review</h2>
			<hr width="100%">
			<p>A lot of people seem to like this one, but personally, I don't see the appeal. This episode is by far one of the most boring episodes in the entire series! This episode has dragged out moments, like the part where SpongeBob is building his bubblestand, it takes about a minute just for that to happen! There's also this long scene of Squidward trying to blow a bubble, which just makes me insanely bored. This episode, like a lot of early Season 1 episodes, has a very low amount of jokes (the only one I found at least chuckle-worthy was the Giraffe one). This isn't one of the worst episodes in the series, but it's still awful thanks to it being insanely boring and having very little amounts of jokes</p>

			<h1>Patrick's Coupon Episode Opinions</h1>

			<h2>Review</h2>
			<hr width="100%">
			<p>It's boring<br>
Patrick acts like his Season 6-7 self<br>

I thought this episode was kinda funny. The first half of this episode was okay, I thought it could've went faster, but the second half is definitly where things are great. The ice-cream king is hilarious, even his voice makes me laugh. The scene is so idiotic that it gets some laughs out of me. I adore the second half, though because of the first, the rating is good. I don't understand the hate for this episode, it's your average silly SpongeBob episode.</p>

			<h1>Patrick Star Character Review</h1>
			<p><i>July 28,2018</i></p>
			<hr width="100%">
			<img src="pat.png" alt="Title card">
			<h2>Humor</h2>
			<hr width="100%">
			<p>One of the main reasons I love him. In most Seasons (exceptions: 6, 9A), I think he's really funny. He's a hilarious guy and I love his one liners (I LOVE YOU, M-O-O-N that spells moon, etc). He's an idiot character done right.</p>
			<h2>Likeability</h2>
			<hr width="100%">
			<p>He's very likeable. While the later Seasons make him not as likeable, he's still decent in the later Seasons. Patrick is awesome and he doesn't do much wrong (exceptions: The Card, Pet Sitter Pat).<br>

Overall, he's an awesome character and probably in my top 5 favorite characters. He's just awesome!</p>
